3. Whatever happens, I'll
leave it all to chance.
Another heartache,
another failed romance.
On and on
Does anybody know what
we are living for?
I guess I'm learning,
I must be warmer now.
I'll soon be turning,
round the corner now.
Outside the dawn is breaking
But inside in the dark
I'm aching to be free### Finalize the Song!
