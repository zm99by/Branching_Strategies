### Finalize the Song!
```
1. Empty spaces - what are we living for?
Abandoned places - I
guess we know the score?
On and on...
Does anybody know what
we are looking for ?
Another hero, another mindless crime
Behind the curtain in the pantomime
Hold the line!
Does anybody want to take it anymore
```
