### Finalize the Song!
1. Empty spaces - what are we living for?
Abandoned places - I
guess we know the score?
On and on...
Does anybody know what
we are looking for ?
Another hero, another mindless crime
Behind the curtain in the pantomime
Hold the line!
Does anybody want to take it anymore



4. Show must go on!
Show must go on! Yeah!
Inside my heart is breaking
My make-up may be flaking
But my smile still stays on.

My soul is painted like
the wings of butterflies.
Fairytales of yesterday
will grow but never die.
I can fly my friends!
